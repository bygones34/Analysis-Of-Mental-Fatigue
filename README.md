# Analysis_Of_Mental_Fatigue
Analysis of mental fatigue via the use of physiological signals.
Two devices were used, a wristband that collects signal datas such as blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, IBI and EDA.
Also another device to collect brain signals such as Alpha, beta, delta signals.
These data were analyzed, augmented.
With the output data set, certain deep learning models were used such as CNN, DNN and LSTM.

This project was a graduation project developed by me, Yasemin Nukan and Ömer Faruk Işık at Istanbul Kultur University.
